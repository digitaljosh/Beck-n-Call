# About

Beck-n-Call functions as an app aggregator that streamlines UI/UX for people who have trouble navigating the typical smart phone application layout.

The on-demand economy (food/groceries/rideshare) has the potential to greatly improve the lives of the aging population and people with learning disabilities; however, the main barrier to this increased autonomy is the cumbersome UI of smartphones and apps. B-n-C would serve as a replacement "home screen" so the target users can more easily navigate and use their smartphones. Caretakers can customize available apps and input restrictions. Users will get a UI that's minimalistic so they can easily order their favorite food, call a friend, or order a ride.
